## Haoyu Li

I received a BSc. degree in Electronics Engineering, and an MSc. degree in Computer Science from Northwest University in 2020 and 2023, respectively. I am currently a Ph.D student in Xi'an Jiaotong University, advised by Prof. Badong Chen. 

My research interest includes brain encoding \& decoding, brain-computer interface (BCI), and neuroscience.
